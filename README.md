#### 📝 Post-session Assignments  

📁 `post-session_assignments/`  

- **`Linear Regression_Student.ipynb`**  
  ‣ Trained a linear regression model to predict student final grades (G3)  
  ‣ Performed feature selection using correlation analysis  
  ‣ Compared performance using different sets of features  
  ‣ Evaluated using R² and RMSE  

- **`Logistic_regression_Student.ipynb`**  
  ‣ Built a logistic regression model to classify pass/fail student outcomes  
  ‣ Applied encoding for categorical variables  
  ‣ Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
  ‣ Compared results with baseline dummy classifiers
